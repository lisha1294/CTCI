//original code

public ArrayList<String>merge(String[] words, String[] more){ //in java this array of strings 
  ArrayList<String> sentence = new ArrayList<String>();
  for(String w:words) sentence.add(w);
  for(String w:more) sentence.add(w);
  return sentence;
}

//This code is an example of an ArrayList (a dynamically resizing array). Typically the size doubles when the array is full. 

// is this code better because it is a resizing array? What is an application of this structure? what are the different java and c++ string functions? 
//what I see is a merging function. why is this not just string.append? is that the equivalent in c++?
//This is ArrayList.cpp but in Java form .. I think
